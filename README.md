## Project1SourceCode

# Main Files
The files contained in the Project1 folder that are not in a subfolder and the primary files responsible for displaying information on the user's computer screen.

# styles Folder
Files contained in the "styles" folder are responsible for augmenting the HTML in the main files using CSS. Most of these files are referenced in the "Header.php" file.

# includes Folder
The "includes" folder contains files that do not explicitly display information on the user's screen but are used primarily for processing information.

# project1_map Folder
This folder holds files that were used in an attempt to connect the Database application with the Google Maps platform. Some of these files have been integrated into the "includes" folder; these files actually display a Google Maps window on the screen.

# How to Use These Files
If you already have XAMPP installed on your computer, running the files contained in this repository is quite simple. If you have not yet installed XAMPP, please install XAMPP first. Then, copy the Project1 folder and paste it in the "htdocs" folder of your "xampp" folder, which was created when XAMPP was installed. For example, the path to my personall XAMPP folder, and where I currently have stored these files, is as follows: C:\xampp\htdocs.

Now, in order to run the files, simply type into the browser of your choice: "localhost/Project1" or "localhost/Project1/index.php".
