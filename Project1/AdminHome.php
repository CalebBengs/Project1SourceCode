    <h2>Administrator Instructions</h2>
    <p>
      This section of the Project1 website is meant exclusively for administrators.
      It was designed to make entering data into the Database powering the Project1
      website both easy and efficient. On the Navigation bar, you will notice multiple
      options that will allow you to alter data in specific Tables in the Databse. The
      "Home" tab will always bring you back to this page. The "Log out" button will
      log the user out of the Administration portion of the Project1 website, locking
      the Administrative privlages as well until the Administrator signs in again.
